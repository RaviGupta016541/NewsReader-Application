# NewsReader-Application
This is my 3rd year mini project.
The NewsReader application is a computer application.
It is used to speak current News.
This application is made in python GUI (Tkinter Library)  with the help of BeautifulSoup library.
BeautifulSoup is used for web scraping.
I used pyttsx3 for text to speech the news that are displayed.
